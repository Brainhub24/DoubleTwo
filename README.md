# DoubleTwo is a file scanner tool developed by Brainhub24.
It is designed to scan a directory and its subdirectories, and find all files that have duplicate content based on their file hash.

The tool can be used to identify duplicate files on a system, which can be helpful for organizing and cleaning up files, as well as for freeing up storage space. The user can specify the directory to be scanned and the tool will generate a report of all duplicate files found.

DoubleTwo is a command-line tool and can be used on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The tool is written in Python and uses the cx_Freeze library to convert the Python code into an executable file that can be run on any system without requiring Python to be installed.

It is worth noting that while DoubleTwo can help identify duplicate files, it does not provide a way to automatically remove them. The user will need to manually review the report generated by the tool and delete the duplicate files as desired.
